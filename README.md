# how-to-load-listbox-as-drop-down-content-of-wpf-dropdownbuttonadv
This sample demonstrates how to load a ListBox as the drop-down content of the WPF DropDownButtonAdv control using Syncfusion's WPF UI components. The DropDownButtonAdv is a versatile control that allows developers to embed custom content within its drop-down area, making it ideal for scenarios where more than just simple menu items are needed.
In this example, the ListBox is used to present a list of selectable items inside the drop-down portion of the button. This approach is useful when you want to provide users with a richer interaction model, such as selecting multiple items or displaying detailed data in a structured format.
The implementation involves defining the ListBox in XAML and assigning it as the drop-down content of the DropDownButtonAdv. You can also customize the appearance, item templates, and selection behavior of the ListBox to suit your application's needs.
